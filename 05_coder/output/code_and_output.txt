# Python program to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ... and multiply the total by 4

total = 0.0

for i in range(10000):
    term = 1 / (2 * i + 1)  # generate the term (1/(2n+1))
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total += term  # add if even index
    else:
        total -= term  # subtract if odd index

result = total * 4
print(result)

Output:
3.141592653589793

This output mirrors the theoretical approximation of Ï€ which this series converges to.
