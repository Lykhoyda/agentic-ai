# Detailed Design for `accounts.py`

## Module Overview

The `accounts.py` module is a self-contained module for managing user accounts in a trading simulation platform. It supports functionalities such as creating an account, depositing and withdrawing funds, recording of buy/sell transactions, calculating portfolio value and profit/loss, and reporting holdings and transaction history. It ensures transactions are only valid if there are sufficient funds/shares.

## Classes and Methods

### Class: `Account`

The `Account` class will represent a user's account in the trading simulation platform. It will manage user funds, shares transactions, and calculations related to portfolio and profit/loss.

#### Methods

- **`__init__(self, user_id: str)`**: Initializes an account for a user with a unique identifier.
  - `user_id`: A unique string identifier for the user.

- **`create_account(self)`**: Prepares the account for use, initializing balance and portfolio.

- **`deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> None`**: Deposits an amount into the account balance.
  - `amount`: The amount of money to deposit. Must be positive.

- **`withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`**: Withdraws funds from the account if the balance is sufficient, otherwise returns False.
  - `amount`: The amount of money to withdraw.

- **`buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`**: Buys a specified quantity of shares if funds are sufficient, otherwise returns False.
  - `symbol`: The stock symbol to buy.
  - `quantity`: The number of shares to buy.

- **`sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`**: Sells a specified quantity of shares if available in the portfolio, otherwise returns False.
  - `symbol`: The stock symbol to sell.
  - `quantity`: The number of shares to sell.

- **`calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`**: Calculates and returns the current total value of the user's portfolio based on current share prices.

- **`calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`**: Calculates and returns the profit or loss based on initial deposits minus current portfolio value.

- **`get_holdings(self) -> dict`**: Returns a dictionary representing the user's current holdings.
  - `return`: Dictionary where keys are stock symbols and values are quantities.

- **`get_transaction_history(self) -> list`**: Returns a list of all the transactions made by the user.
  - `return`: List of dictionaries containing transaction details.

- **`get_profit_loss_report(self) -> dict`**: Provides a detailed report of the user's profit or loss.
  - `return`: A dictionary with detailed profit/loss calculation.

### Utilized External Function

- **`get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`**: A function accessible by this module, returning the current price for the specified stock symbol.

## Design Considerations

- Each method ensuring transactions respect account constraints i.e., preventing negative balances, or unauthorized share selling.
- Error handling for invalid transactions or operations.
- A testable and extendable structure, making it simple to integrate a user interface or further backend components.

## Assumptions

- `get_share_price()` provides a stable and reliable interface with the correct current price.
- The user interface or calling program handles inputs and parsing to and from this module correctly, including data types.
